    "1. Efficiently combining, counting, and iterating\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll cover combining, counting, and iterating over objects efficiently. Let's begin by exploring a dataset from the popular Nintendo video game Pokémon.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Pokémon Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Pokémon game centers around players called trainers that try to collect fictional animals called Pokémon.\n",
    "These Pokémon animals roam the fictional universe where the game takes place. When a trainer encounters a Pokémon, they try to capture that Pokémon to add to their collection.\n",
    "If a trainer successfully captures a Pokémon, it is stored in a tool called a Pokédex.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Pokémon Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Each Pokémon comes with its own set of metadata.\n",
    "This metadata contains a name for each Pokémon. It also has the generation of each Pokémon specifying what version of the game the Pokémon appears in. Here, Squirtle, a Pokémon from generation one, is shown.\n",
    "The metadata also includes the Pokémon's Type and whether or not it belongs to a special category called Legendary.\n",
    "Each Pokémon has a set of statistics that are numerical values for certain categories like Health Points (called HP), Attack, and others. We'll use a dataset that contains pieces of this metadata for the remainder of the chapter.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Combining objects\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have two lists: one of Pokémon names and another of each Pokémon's Health Points. We want to combine these lists so that each Pokémon is stored next to its Health Points. We can iterate over the names list using enumerate and grab each Pokémon's corresponding Health Points using the index variable.\n",

    "    > names = p'Bulbasaur', 'Charmander', 'Squirtle']\n",
    "    \n",
    "    > hps = [45, 39, 44]\n",
    "    \n",
    "5. Combining objects with zip\n",
    "\n",
    "But Python's built-in function zip provides a more elegant solution. The name \"zip\" describes how this function combines objects like a zipper on a jacket (making two separate things become one). zip returns a zip object that must be unpacked into a list and printed to see the contents. Each item is a tuple of elements from the original lists.\n",

    "Our Pokémon dataset describes 720 characters. Here is a list of each Pokémon's corresponding type. We'd like to create a dictionary where each key is a Pokémon type, and each value is the count of characters that belong to that type. Using a standard dictionary approach, we have to instantiate an empty output dictionary. Then, we iterate over the poke_types list and check whether or not each poke_type exists within the type_counts dictionary. If the poke_type is not in the dictionary, we create a new key and initialize its count value as one. If the poke_type is already in the dictionary, we update the count by one.\n",

Counter returns a Counter dictionary of key-value pairs. When printed, it's ordered by highest to lowest counts. If comparing runtime times, we'd see that using Counter takes half the time as the standard dictionary approach!\n",

    "\n",
    "10. Combinations with loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we want to gather all combination pairs of Pokémon types possible. We can do this with a nested for loop that iterates over the poke_types list twice. Notice that a conditional statement is used to skip pairs having the same type twice. For example, if x is 'Bug' and y is 'Bug', we want to skip this pair. Since we're interested in combinations (where order doesn't matter), another statement is used to ensure either order of the pair doesn't already exist within the combos list before appending it. For example, the pair ('Bug', 'Fire') is the same as the pair ('Fire', 'Bug'). We want one of these pairs, not both.\n",

    "\n",
    "11. itertools.combinations()\n",
    "\n",
    "The combinations generator from itertools provides a more efficient solution. First, we import combinations and then create a combinations object by providing the poke_types list and the length of combinations we desire. combinations returns a combinations object, which we unpack into a list and print to see the result. If comparing runtimes, we'd see using combinations is significantly faster than the nested loop.\n",

    "1. Set theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, we'd like to compare two objects to observe similarities and differences between their contents. When doing this type of comparison, it's best to leverage a branch of mathematics called set theory. As you know, Python comes with a built-in set data type. Sets come with some handy methods we can use for comparing. We'll explore each of these methods later on. The main takeaway is that when we'd like to compare objects multiple times and in different ways, we should consider storing our data in sets to leverage these elegant and efficient methods. Another nice feature of Python sets is their ability to quickly check if a value exists within its members. We call this membership testing. In this lesson, we'll show that using the in operator with a set is much faster than using it with a list or tuple. Let's explore a few examples.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Comparing objects with set theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we should use Python's set data type to compare these lists. By converting each list into a set, we can use the dot-intersection method to collect the Pokémon shared between the two sets. One simple line of code and no need for a loop!\n",

Thus, we can use a set to collect unique items from an existing object. Let's revisit the primary_types list, which contains the primary types of each Pokémon. If we wanted to collect the unique Pokémon types within this list, we could write a for loop to iterate over the list, and only append the Pokémon types that haven't already been added to the unique_types list.\n",

    "### Eliminating loops\n",
    "1. Looping in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes with a few looping patterns that can be used when we want to iterate over an object's contents. For loops iterate over elements of a sequence piece-by-piece. While loops execute a loop repeatedly as long as some Boolean condition is met. Nested loops use multiple loops inside one another. Although all of these looping patterns are supported by Python, we should be careful when using them. Because most loops are evaluated in a piece-by-piece manner, they are often an inefficient solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    * for\n",
    "    * while\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Benefits of eliminating loops\n",
    "\n",
    "We should try to avoid looping as much as possible when writing efficient code. Eliminating loops usually results in fewer lines of code that are easier to interpret. Recall in a previous lesson we referred to the Zen of Python - a collection of idioms for writing Pythonic code. One of these idioms was \"flat is better than nested.\" Striving to eliminate loops in our code will help us follow this idiom. In the following examples, we'll see that there are often more efficient approaches that can be used instead of using a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > \"Flat is better than nested\"\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Eliminating loops with built-ins\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have a list of lists, called poke_stats, that contains statistical values for each Pokémon. Each row corresponds to a Pokémon, and each column corresponds to a Pokémon's specific statistical value. Here, the columns represent a Pokémon's Health Points, Attack, Defense, and Speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to do a simple sum of each of these rows in order to collect the total stats for each Pokémon. If we were to use a loop to calculate row sums, we would have to iterate over each row and append the row's sum to the totals list. We can accomplish the same task, in fewer lines of code, with a list comprehension. Or, we could use the built-in map function that we've discussed previously.\n",
    "\n",
    "> for row in poke_stats:\n",
    "    totals.append(sum(row))\n",
    "\n",
    "> totals_comp = [sum(row) for row in poke_stats]\n",
    "\n",
    "> totals_map = [*map(sum, poke_stats)]\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these approaches will return the same list, but using a list comprehension or the map function takes one line of code, and has a faster runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Eliminating loops with built-in modules\n",
    "\n",
    "We've also covered a few built-in modules that can help us eliminate loops. Remember when we collected the different combinations of Pokémon types? Instead of using the nested for loop, we used combinations from the itertools module for a cleaner, more efficient solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "> from itertools import combinations\n",
    "\n",
    "> combos2 = [*combinations(poke_types, 2)]\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Eliminate loops with NumPy\n",
    "\n",
    "Another powerful technique for eliminating loops is to use the NumPy package. Suppose we had the same collection of statistics we used in a previous example but stored in a NumPy array instead of a list of lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'd like to collect the average stat value for each Pokémon (or row) in our array. We could use a loop to iterate over the array and collected the row averages. But, NumPy arrays allow us to perform calculations on entire arrays all at once. Here, we use the dot-mean method and specifying an axis equal to 1 to calculate the mean for each row (meaning we calculate an average across the column values). This eliminates the need for a loop and is much more efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "> avgs_np = poke_stats.mean(axis=1)\n",
    "\n",
    "When comparing runtimes, we see that using the dot-mean method on the entire array and specifying an axis is significantly faster than using a loop.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Writing better loops\n",
    "\n",
    "The best way to make a loop more efficient is to analyze what's being done within the loop. We want to make sure that we aren't doing unnecessary work in each iteration. \n",
    "   * If a calculation is performed for each iteration of a loop, but its value doesn't change with each iteration, it's best to move this calculation outside (or above) the loop. \n",
    "   * If a loop is converting data types with each iteration, it's possible that this conversion can be done outside (or below) the loop using a map function. Anything that can be done once should be moved outside of a loop. \n",

    "\n",
    "4. Moving calculations above a loop\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a list of Pokémon names and an array of each Pokémon's corresponding attack value. We'd like to print the names of each Pokémon with an attack value greater than the average of all attack values. To do this, we'll use a loop that iterates over each Pokémon and their attack value. For each iteration, the total attack average is calculated by finding the mean value of all attacks. Then, each Pokémon's attack value is evaluated to see if it exceeds the total average. Can you spot the inefficiency? The total_attack_avg variable is being created with each iteration of the loop. But, this calculation doesn't change between iterations since it is an overall average. We only need to calculate this value once.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Moving calculations above a loop\n",

Remember, zip returns a collection of tuples, so we need to convert each tuple into a list since we want to create a list of lists as our output. Now, we append each individual poke_list to our poke_data output variable. By printing the result, we see our desired list of lists. However, converting each tuple to a list within the loop is not very efficient.\n",

    "Instead, we should collect all of our poke_tuples together, and use the map function to convert each tuple to a list. The loop no longer converts tuples to lists with each iteration. Instead, we moved this tuple to list conversion outside (or below) the loop. That way, we convert data types all at once (or holistically) rather than converting in each iteration.\n",
